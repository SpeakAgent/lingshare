Install Instructions
====================

NOTE: At the moment, all libraries that are being used are linked off of a CDN. 
This will change soon, but until then, a bower install isn't necessary.

What is required is the lexemes/LexDB application. In order for this site to 
work, that applicaiton must be installed and running.

Instructions
------------

Check out the code (where doesn't matter) and cd into the site directory.

----
$ git clone https://github.com/SpeakAgent/lingshare
$ cd site
----

In order for AngularJS to work properly, we'll need a webserver. 

----
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 5000
----

Once that's running, you should be able to access the site at 127.0.0.1:5000. 
Note that sometimes, the firewall will pop up a warning, asking if you want to 
allow connections on that port. Just click "Allow".
